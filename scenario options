scenario options
================

-increase density based on existing zoning districts

-increase density based on urban form considerations
	-could or could not conform to existing zoning districts
	-makes the most sense on the corridors

-action-based scenarios, e.g. 100% aff overlay
	-may involve to many assumptions to be meaningful
	(e.g. what % of parcels, or which parcels under what conditions, go 100% aff)
